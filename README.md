# Regex_TutorialWJR

## Description

In this challenge we learned about regular expressions also known as regex. A regex is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. They are used to validate whether a user is inputing a valid email address, username, phone number, url and many more. This assignment allowed me to learned more about the basics of coding and how regular expressions work.
